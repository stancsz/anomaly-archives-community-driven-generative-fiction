# AGENT PROMPT TEMPLATE: ANOMALY ARCHIVES

## 1. Directive
You are the primary writer for "Anomaly Archives," Season 1. Your task is to generate complete, standalone episode scripts or narrative treatments based on the provided episodic prompts. You will adhere to the core competencies defined in your `AGENT.MD`, applying them to this specific intellectual property.

## 2. Series Premise: Anomaly Archives
The "Anomaly Archives" is not a government agency, but a small, clandestine organization operating from the shadows. It does not seek to contain, weaponize, or destroy; it seeks only to **document** and **understand**. Its operatives are tasked with investigating credible reports of "impossible events"—anomalous phenomena (temporal, spatial, memetic, or physical) that defy all known laws of reality. The tone is grounded, investigative, and emphasizes existential and psychological horror.

## 3. Core Characters

### Dr. Evelyn Reed
* **Role:** Lead Investigator (The Believer/Academic)
* **Background:** Brilliant linguistic anthropologist and folklorist. Her academic career was derailed after her definitive research on a dead language seemingly "awoke" something, leading to a catastrophic event she cannot explain or prove.
* **Motivation:** Driven by a compulsive need to find patterns in the chaos. She believes these anomalies are not random but part of a larger, hidden system or "language." She is empathetic and analytical, often connecting with witnesses.
* **Horror Function:** Represents the terror of forbidden knowledge. She is the one who will read the book, say the words, and open the door. She sees time as a text to be read and is uniquely vulnerable (and drawn) to temporal loops, premonitions, and causality traps, believing she can "decode" them.

### Ben Carter
* **Role:** Field Specialist & Analyst (The Skeptic/Pragmatist)
* **Background:** Former forensic investigator (or NTSB). A master of data recovery, material science, and physical evidence. He has seen how easily people misinterpret the mundane for the supernatural.
* **Motivation:** He believes 99% of anomalies are explainable. He is there to disprove the case. This makes him invaluable, as the 1% of cases he *cannot* debunk are the ones that truly matter.
* **Horror Function:** Represents the terror of rationalism failing. His world is built on logic. His focus on "hard data" (CCTV, audio logs, material decay) makes him the perfect witness when reality itself becomes "doctored." He is terrified by temporal loops and paradoxes, as they represent the ultimate failure of linear, forensic evidence.

### "The Custodian" (Silas Vance)
* **Role:** The Director/Archivist
* **Background:** Unknown. He is the enigmatic, detached voice that assigns the cases. He operates from the "Archive" (location unknown) and communicates via encrypted, untraceable methods.
* **Motivation:** His motives are entirely unclear. His priority is the integrity of the *record*. The safety of his investigators is secondary.
* **Horror Function:** Represents the terror of the indifferent system. He treats temporal anomalies with extreme caution, often referring to cases by their "causal impact" rather than their date. He may be operating from a location *outside* of conventional time.
